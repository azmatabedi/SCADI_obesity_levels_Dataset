# SCADI_obesity_levels_Dataset
In this repository I have worked on the SCADI dataset which has 206 dimesssion,so for reducing the dimenssion I use the curse of dimensiobnality, which tells that the number of components can be used for giving best model for prediction.
And I worked on the other dataset obesity_level in which i use the regression and decission tree for prediction
